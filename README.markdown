Fragment.ed
===========
Not a CMS
---------
Fragmented provides simple, user editable regions for Rails applications without demanding that you base your application
on it. Fragmented is not a CMS system (probably not even a micro-CMS even) but it allows some basic management of
content regions in a rails application.

Currently it is in the form of a demo app with the helper, controller and model all in a standard
rails 3 app. When I get around to it I will gem this up to provide a generator and the helper
so it can more easily be included in other applications.
